This project provides a detailed analysis of the key factors influencing loan approval and default risk using Power BI. The analysis focuses on **credit history**, **self-employment status based on household group**, and **property area based on household group**, which are critical in determining loan status (Approved: Y / Rejected: N).

## üîç Project Objective

To uncover insights that help financial institutions improve their loan approval strategies while minimizing risk, especially across different household income groups (B40, M40, T20).

## üìä Tools Used

- **Power BI**: For interactive dashboards, data visualizations, and insight discovery.

## üìà Key Insights

### 1. **Credit History**
- **Primary determinant** of loan approval.
- A strong credit history significantly **increases the chances of loan approval** and **reduces default risk**.
- **Recommendation**: Promote credit card adoption among potential applicants to build a credit history, especially among underserved groups.

### 2. **Self-Employment Based on Household Group**
- Self-employed individuals in the **M40 group** have **lower loan approval rates**.
- **Recommendation**: Reduce approval for self-employed M40 applicants to control risk.
- **Increase approval** for **B40 applicants in rural areas** to support inclusive economic growth.

### 3. **Property Area Based on Household Group**
- Property area (urban, semi-urban, rural) plays a significant role when combined with household income group.
- Rural properties owned by B40 applicants show **lower default risk**, while M40 applicants in urban areas show **higher risk**.
- **Recommendation**: Adjust loan policies based on a combination of property area and income group.
